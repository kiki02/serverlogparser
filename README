Project IDE:
    You can import this project into eclipse.

Description:
    This is a Java application that parses web server access log file. After parsing, the application can check if a given IP makes more than a certain number of requests for the given duration.

Setup:
    - Should run with above JDK 1.7
    - Open file "config.properties", you can modify the MySQL server connection configurations.

Run:
    - you can run the application with the below command line: 
    java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --accesslog=/path/to/file --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=hourly --threshold=100
    - For convenient, the application can self setup the database for it, so you can run the application with/without seting up the database by the MySQL schema file.
    
MySQL schema file: 
    - wallethub_db.sql

SQL queries for testing:
(1) Write MySQL query to find IPs that mode more than a certain number of requests for a given time period.
    Ex: Write SQL to find IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00.
    => SELECT * FROM (SELECT IP,COUNT(*) as count FROM access_log_table WHERE DATE >= '2017-01-01.13:00:00' AND DATE < DATE_ADD('2017-01-01.13:00:00', INTERVAL 1 HOUR) GROUP BY IP) AS ListIP WHERE ListIP.count >= 100 ORDER BY ListIP.count DESC;
    
(2) Write MySQL query to find requests made by a given IP.
    => SELECT * FROM access_log_table WHERE IP = '192.168.11.231' ORDER BY DATE ASC;
